## About bootstrap
>For standardization, best practices and responsiveness, when developing new pages, think about the structure of rows and columns following the grid pattern.

**Example:**

| Grid pattern class | Description                                                                    |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.container`       | Container with spacing on the sides (width: 1200px).                           |
| `.container-fluid` | Container without spacing on the sides(width: 100%).                           |
| `.row`             | Single div, must be used as a parent div that will have 1 to 12 col child divs |
| `.col`             | Single div, must be used as a parent div that will have 1 to 12 child divs     | 

>***The pattern shown above in the table shows the structure of the project's html pages, new pages must follow the pattern.***
